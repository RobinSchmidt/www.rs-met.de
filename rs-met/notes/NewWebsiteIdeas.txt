Create a private github repo with the current website

-Create a new version of the website in a "new" folder - or maybe make a separate repo


Structure:
-Home: Welcome, self-introduction, screenshots
-Software: ToolChain as main product, sub-modules are explained below
-Soundware: presets, soundpacks (samples, loops), stems, demo-tracks, midi files
-Social: links to presences on YouTube, Facebook, KVR, email (maybe github, too)
-Resources: tutorials, papers, github code, maybe make a blog, links to KVR threads
-About: 
 -More detailed self-description
 -Imprint and other legaly notices
 -Legacy: copy of the older version of the website, maybe also braindoc.de, legacy versions
-Misc
 -Other software (not audio-related)
 
Appearance:
-New website should be in dark mode, maybe light mode should be optionally available
-Screenshots should feature several color-schemes. the scope should use a nice colormap


ToDo:

-[done] Re-organize the sub-pages:
 -"Home"       stays as is
 -"Products"   becomes "Software"
 -"Freebies"   becomes "Soundware"
 -"Support"    becomes "Social"
 -"Tutorials"  becomes "Resources"
 -"Company"    becomes "About"
 -"Misc"       stays as is (but maybe with different content)
-[done] Maybe try an even darker background like rgb(30,40, 50) instead of (40,50,60)

-The "Social" page should have a link to the github presence, too.
-Maybe the content of the "Social" page could be absorbed into the "About" page
-Maybe "Software" and "Soundware" could be merged into a single page (maybe call it "Products" 
 again)
-Maybe create TikTok and Instagram accounts - there, I could publish short loops as "reels" where 
 a DAW is running a sequence in a loop, showing visualtizations (scope, analyzer, etc.) and/or use
 some WinAmp AVS / Milkdrop style visualtization.
-Maybe rename "Soundware" into "Sounds" - then we may also increase the font-size by 1 point again.
-Maybe have a page for demos...maybe it could include also full tracks ...but maybe a Music page
 could also be added. But maybe the Demos could also be found on the "Sounds" page. After all, the 
 Demos are all created using Presets, so that could make sense


-Implement a screenshot function in ToolChain and take some new screenshots of the new/updated 
 modules. Use the new favorite color-schame (BlueishDarkGray.xml, iirc).
-Try to create the collage on the start-page on the fly from separate screenshots, if possible, i.e.
 we don't need a separate image file for the screenshot. I don't really know if that's possible.
 It seems so - see:

-The disclaimer should go to the "Software" page - not on the main page
