Create a private github repo with the current website

-Create a new version of the website in a "new" folder - or maybe make a separate repo


Structure:
-Home: Welcome, self-introduction, screenshots
-Software: ToolChain as main product, sub-modules are explained below
-Soundware: presets, soundpacks (samples, loops), stems, demo-tracks, midi files
-Social: links to presences on YouTube, Facebook, KVR, email (maybe github, too)
-Resources: tutorials, papers, github code, maybe make a blog, links to KVR threads
-About: 
 -More detailed self-description
 -Imprint and other legaly notices
 -Legacy: copy of the older version of the website, maybe also braindoc.de, legacy versions
-Misc
 -Other software (not audio-related)
 
Appearance:
-New website should be in dark mode, maybe light mode should be optionally available
-Screenshots should feature several color-schemes. the scope should use a nice colormap


ToDo:

-Re-organize the sub-pages:
 -"Home"       stays as is
 -"Products"   becomes "Software"
 -"Freebies"   becomes "Soundware"
 -"Support"    becomes "Social"
 -"Tutorials"  becomes "Resources"
 -"Company"    becomes "About"
 -"Misc"       stays as is (but maybe with different content)

-Implement a screenshot function in ToolChain and take some new screenshots of the new/updated 
 modules. Use the new favorite color-schame (BlueishDarkGray.xml, iirc).
-Try to create the collage on the start-page on the fly from separate screenshots, if possible, i.e.
 we don't need a separate image file for the screenshot. I don't really know if that's possible.
 It seems so - see:

-The disclaimer should go to the "Software" page - not on the main page
